# Static-Site-Generator

A static site generator. It takes markdown(.md) files and generates html pages out of them (static sites).
The code can generate any number of static sites if we make the markdown file for it with the content and images.
As of now it generates a main static page(Tolkien Fan Club) with four more, inside four links , **glorfindel** | **tom** | **majesty** at the top and **contact** at the bottom.
All of the static sites are generated recursively from our python code.
